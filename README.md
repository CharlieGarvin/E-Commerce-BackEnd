# E-Commerce-BackEnd

## Description
This app is showing my ability to use sequelize to work the backend of sites. 

## Usage
You are able to retrieve all of the categories, products, and tags. You can also get one category, product, or tag by using the id. You are able to create new categories and delete categories if you need to.

## Installation
Users will need to have MySQL and Insomnia installed to be able to run the application. 

## Future Development
I want to add the functionality so you can update categories and products. I also want to add funtionality so users are able to add, update and delete products.
